# Fall2023_IDS706 Mini Project 1
### Purpose
This is for class data engineering mini-project 1. 
This is a Python GitHub template that will be used for the rest of the class (Makefile, GitHub Actions, requirements.txt,
README.md, .devcontainer).

### Steps
1. I created the template based on the template and video posted by Professor Noah Gift and modified the template based on requirement on syllabus.
2. In main.py, an add function is created. 
3. In test_main.py, the assert command is used.

### Check format and test errors:
In codespace, I run command make test, make format, and make lint.
The commands run smoothly.
